## About
A sample application to show how to use EditControl as a non module library, in otherwords load it using just script tags rather than using some module system.


The dependencies have been manually downloaded and stored in the lib folder.  
Instead of manually downloading you could,  
use npm to download these dependencies and use script tags to point to them inside the "node_modules" folder or  
use cdn urls in script tages  

The dependencies needed are 
* pepjs  - A polyfill to provide pointer support on old browser. 
* babylonjs
* babylonjs-editcontrol

## Run
Open index.html in browser.
